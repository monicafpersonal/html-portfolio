<p><h3> Pitch Perfect 1 & 2</h3></p>
<p> 10 /10. funny as well as sarcastic. The movie is about an acapella soriety involving a group of girls who get closer to
     each other as they try to win championships by stepping out 
    of their comfort zone and finding their voice.

<p><h3> Wake Up Dead Man, Knives Out Mystery</h3></p>
<p> 10/10. I have watched this movies like 30 times, amazing. Its a murder mystery movie that 
    keeps you guessing who is the killer. The movie is centered in the murder of a priest, his followers, and another
    bishop who are suspectes and all have motives. Are they all murders or they just simply hated the priest.

<p><h3> Mr. Peabody & Sherman </h3></p>
<p> 7/10. Its funny and its a cartoon but im more interested in singing or mystery movies.
    The movie is about a dog aka Mr.Peabody and his adopted son Sherman who time travel to expierince history because his father
    the dog is a genious, Einstein geniuos. Mr. Peabody likes making puns and is very charismatic 
    and the fact that hes accredited alot of stuff is funny.
