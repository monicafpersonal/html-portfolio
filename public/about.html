<h1>About Me</h1>
<h1> Welcome to knowing me  </h1> 
<hr/>
 
    <p> My name is Monica a stay at home mom who decided to start coding to 
     hopefully retire my blue collar husband. He works too much and sees our 2 daughter momentarily every day. Im currently
    25 right now but this year im going to be 26 and my goal would be finishing the year with a vast knowledge in coding and hopefully finding a career in coding.
    So far what i've learned has truly made me enjoy coding and I truly see myself working long-term.</p>

<h2> Washington State </h2>
    <p> Lived in secluded town know as Prosser, amazing views, horrible prices.
    Gas was high about 4 dollars and our aparment cost 850 for our 1 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment with a shared washing machines
    which was only one for like 8 rooms. The front office lady was probably the closest thing i had for a friend. Loved it, except the hospital, horrible people.
    My firstborne, Mirela Guevara was born in the hospital Prosser memorial hospital and her pedriatician Dr. Weaver also the man who delivered my daughter, his practice was located in Sunnyside </p>

<h2> Lousiana </h2>
     <p> I currently live here Luling, LA not as secluded near New Orleans, a 30 min drive or so. 
        In this state is where i had my second born in Metarie to be exact in a hospital called LCMC hospital
    . Not my favorite state so far its very charming the scenery, the state is coved in swaps, alot of water everywhere
    and definitely the alligators that are present everywhere including a park. Not a lot of friendly people honestly, theirs 
    always some type of level of hostility when i go out, even outside my aparment. </p>
